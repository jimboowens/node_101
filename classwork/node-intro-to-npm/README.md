java came out in 1995, and was done in 11 days to stay ahead of Windows, and it's also called ECMAScript

in 2008, the chromium project came out after starting in 2006.
    their script engine was called v8, which is a converter that "transpiles" the information into more primitive data languages, which are then translated into binary. Starting with C, then byte code.
